# -v0.0.1
# First release, September the 30th

This contains a Ryzentosh EFI system with those specs:

##B500m_aorus_elite-v1.3

##5800x3D

##Rx580_4gb

The Bootloader/EFi works for SONOMA and SEQUOIA 

On Sonoma (The Sleep_mode doesn't work but everything else such as the wifi/bluetooth/audio etc works)

On Sequoia (The Audio and the Sleep_mode doesn't work. The audio seems to be a major problem for the majority of the ryzentoshes use voodoo_HD instead.

-Thanks in advance
