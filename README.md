# -v0.0.2
# Second release, Octomber the 16th
same problems as the prviouse release (v0.0.1)

# -v0.0.1
# First release, September the 30th

This contains a Ryzentosh EFI system with those specs:

# MOBO ## B500m_aorus_elite-v1.3

# CPU ## 5800x3D

# GPU ## Rx580

The Bootloader/EFI works for both SONOMA and SEQUOIA 

On Sonoma (The Sleep_mode doesn't work but everything else such as the wifi/bluetooth/audio etc works)

On Sequoia (The Audio and the Sleep_mode doesn't work. The audio seems to be a major problem for the majority of the ryzentoshes use voodoo_HD instead.

-Thanks in advance
